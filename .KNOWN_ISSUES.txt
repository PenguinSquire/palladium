no file size limit means videos occasionally corrupt at the end
    videos occasinally corrupt regardless of size???

maybe add warning if a lot of images are being downloaded?
    i dont know how to check for this before all of the images are downloaded
        i could check the length of the object of the link before downloading anything

add error logging in order to be able to see what's going on
