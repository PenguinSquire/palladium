my attempt at a fork of the Cobalt discord bot
https://discord.com/application-directory/1093352359989612627

run `node index.js` to start the bot
<br />
<br />
`node dev-deploy.js` to update the guild commands. This will deploy commands in all folders.

`node global-deploy.js` to update the global commands. This only deploys the commands in the "global" folder

`node deleteAll.js` to delete all commands
