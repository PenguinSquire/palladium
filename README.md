# palladium  
my attempt at a fork of the unofficial Cobalt discord bot: https://discord.com/application-directory/1093352359989612627  
<br />  
run `node index.js` to start the bot

`node dev-deploy.js` to update the guild commands. This will deploy commands in the `guild` and `dev` folders.  
`node global-deploy.js` to update the global commands. This will deploy commands in the `global` and `universal` folders  
`node deleteAll.js` to delete all commands
